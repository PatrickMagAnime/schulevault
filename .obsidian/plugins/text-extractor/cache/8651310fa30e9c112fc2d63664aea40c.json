It's sad to hear that Mac isn't geng along very well with his Classmates, but I don't think it's as bad as it seems. But from what you told me, there's only an Instagram Account, which posts memes about him and in the class during school he doesn't get harassed. So, I think, that the Account is from some jerks who are there to pick on anyone that they feel like at the moment to get Aenon. I would recommend him and you to not give them that, and they will search another one to annoy. However, my bulling experience is almost none, so keep an eye on it as long as the bullying or the consequences of it don't transion into the real world, he is going to be ﬁne in my opinion. To close out posively, the school opening party was great. In my opinion, it's such a nice way to start the year, so get to meet the people you haven't met in the last 3 months and can catch up easily. I'll look forward to your reply and for further development to the Mac Situaon. Stefan 195w","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
