1. What we can see in the diagram is the sun that is beaming sun rays on the earth. The earth is reflecting some sun rays back into the atmosphere but most of them get absorbed.              So basically, the sun beams are trapped by the greenhouse gases and this causes the increase of the global temperature. This is called the greenhouse effect.

2. In Austria, It is possible that animals could die out, because of the change in degrees. And the USA could face more heat waves than usual. This could cause forest fires or severe weather.

3. The different ways how we could reduce greenhouse gases are, reducing our energy consumption, for example, using the computer less often, and switching to renewable energy sources like solar or wind power for our homes and businesses.
