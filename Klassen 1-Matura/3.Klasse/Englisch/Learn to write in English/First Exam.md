Are internships a good thing?

Hello guys! Today I want to share my thoughts on internships.

Firstly, lets talk about their advantages. In my opinion, internships are a very good way to earn money fluidly and legally. Additionally, you gain practical experience too, and you might find your dream job for later, or make business acquaintances.

Moreover, an average employee’s salary is well-paid too. The gains for employer’s side are that they can improve their communication skills with younger people. Most people don’t know to explain things at work to interns, so every employee is encouraged to work with them. That causes unintended social training.

Lastly, one of the challenges job seekers could face, is that they mightn’t find a job because of many possibilities filled. This makes it increasingly harder to find a job for people who actually need it.

Thank you for reading. What are your thought on internships? Let me know below in the comments.

How we could make the world a better place

Have you ever heard of the 5Rs?

As we all know, the world is going under. Or isn’t it? This article is about how we can save the world by protecting our environment. That’s why I want to explain what the 5Rs are.

Firstly, the 5Rs provide guidance on how we can reduce waste in the most efficient way. One of them is recycling. Many schools and companies are concerned about reducing their waste. This is why many facilities collect plastic bottles to recycle them.

Moreover, we could reuse items too. The most common example of a reused item is the couch from an old friend or from your grandpa. But what is if we reuse everything we can think of? For example, an old computer instead of buying a new one.

The next R focuses on renewing things. This is for people who enjoy repairing items. By not simply reusing something, we could renew them, so we could sell them to others or use them on ourselves.

It can be suggested that, schools should recycle and separate their waste. A significant point is that schools produce a huge amount of waste that damages the environment a lot. That’s why schools should apply one of the 5Rs too.

In conclusion it may be said that we could minimise the waste of usable material or even food. Of course food can’t be repaired, but by simply applying one of the 5Rs we could make the world a better place.
