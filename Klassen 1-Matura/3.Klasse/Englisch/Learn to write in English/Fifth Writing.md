#### First try
The only way to make something eco-friendly

Hey guys! Welcome to my in-house blog-post. My name is Stefanius and I came up with a few ideas how we could make the company more eco-friendly. As an intern of MKE that has a lot of experience, I just want the best for the firm.

Firstly to mention, is that sustainability is the most important thing at a workplace. Everyone would be delightful, if his workplace is clean and his firm green. Especially at companies that are specialised on International Technology.

The next thing is, that it is easily affordable and cheap to make a company greener. By simply placing plants in each room or just by using the train to drive to work, instead of driving with a car.

Last but not least, employees would be happy too, if they become a full box of vegetables. The company could switch the complete canteen to vegan food. This is not only sustainable for other animals, it is actually cheaper too, which is definitely one of the biggest benefits.

Thank you for reading my blog-post. What is your opinion on making the company more green? Let me know below in the comments.
