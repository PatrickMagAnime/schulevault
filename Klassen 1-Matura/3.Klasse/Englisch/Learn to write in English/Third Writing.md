Hello Morgan, my name is Stefanius and I recently came across your blog-post about animals at educational institutions. I'm writing this comment in regard to ensure you that pets are not that dangerous tho and can have some benefits too.

Firstly, I'll say that pets might be an innovative education and experience for young adolescents. Moreover they can learn how to handle other living beings. I also do not think that they would get sick from germs. So I can't completely agree with your opinion.

You could also keep in mind that young children might be scared of some sorts of pets. The next important thing to check is if a child has allergies to some animals.

The last significant point I want to address is that you should respect the animals comfort zone. Don't over stress the pet. Dogs for example are very sensitive, especially when a bunch of people are around them.

I hope this comment will help you.

Thank you for your post. Good luck to find and adapt a pet at your institution. I'm looking forward to your next posts!
