Subject: Project for Elden Ring

Dear Manager of Techtech electronics,

My name is Steven and last summer I worked as an intern in your company. I was wondering, if it is possible, to work on a big project idea that I developed on my own. My idea was to create something new that will help every gamer that is interested in computer games and is playing Elden-Ring all day.

During my internship in your company, I learned a lot of new things that will definitely help me in future life. The tool I worked on during my Internship was a controller with an additional port where you can stick something in, for example a third joystick or additional buttons.

My project will deal with a lot of Elden-Ring based controllers to make the best experience for the customers later, while they are playing Elden-Ring with it. It should be handsome to hold and light too.

I think you should collaborate with me because Elden-Ring is a very famous Role-Play game with intense fighting. This is why we should produce controllers and sell them to the community of Elden-Ring.

Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Yours sincerely
Steven Elderingius

Dear Manager of techtech electronics,

My name is Steven and last summer I worked as an intern in your company. I was inquiring if it would be possible to work on a big project idea that I developed on my own. My idea was to create something new that will help every gamer that is interested in video games and spend long hours playing Elden-Ring all day.

During my internship at your company, I learned a lot of new things that will definitely help me in my future career. The tool I worked on during my internship was a controller with an additional port where you can stick something in, for example a third joystick or additional buttons.

My project focuses on designing Elden-Ring themed controllers to make the best experience for customers later, while they are playing Elden-Ring with it. It should be comfortable to hold and lightweight too.

I think you should collaborate with me because Elden-Ring is a very famous Role-Play game with intense fighting. This is why we should produce such controllers and market them to the community of Elden-Ring.

Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Yours sincerely
