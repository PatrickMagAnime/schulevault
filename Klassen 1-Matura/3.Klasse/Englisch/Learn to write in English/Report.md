Subject: **What employees think about their feedback from their superior**

**Introduction**
This report outlines the results of a survey called "What employees think about their superiors" conducted by Patrick Riedl. 36 employees participated in the survey and the results clearly show us that the superiors actually do not care about newer employees.

**Main findings**
The graph clearly demonstrates that a fifth of superiors care about newer employees, while the other 11% do not and 5% were unsure. Only ten percent of superiors recognised good work of their employees while 26% do not care. Six percent of superiors gave positive feedback on their workers while 30 do not. According to the chart the fore last ranked question was if the expectations were fulfilled by the employees and six percent of the superiors stated that they were not and the other 27 said yes.
The last but not least, the participants were asked, if they had any regular team meetings, where 12 percent of superiors held them, and 24% not even considered them.

**The Importance of giving Feedback**
It is important to give feedback to your own employees especially when they are not aware of their mistakes. Giving feedback will improve their work, makes it more time-efficient and has a lot of more advantages.

**Recommendation**
The results of the survey clearly reveal that a lot of superiors are not sure what to do. Based on the findings it can be suggested that superiors should help employees more, especially when they are new at the company.
In conclusion, giving newer employees feedback will help them a lot at their workplace.
